# Lulu

**Lulu** is a simple runtime for Lua. I made it to make developing, bundling, and distributing Lua applications simpler.

### Core Features

- **Project Management:** Structure your code as a formal project with a simple `lulu.conf.lua` manifest file.
- **Dependency Resolution:** Fetch dependencies directly from GitHub repositories or other URLs.
- **Powerful Macro System:** Extend the Lua language with compile-time macros for features like conditional compilation, enums, classes, and more.
- **Configuration Based Bundling:** Bundle your entire project, including all dependencies, into a single library bundle file or a standalone executable.
