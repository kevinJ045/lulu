# Lulu
A simple Lua runtime that also helps with bundling Lua code, resolving Lua requirements, and building a final executable with libraries.

## Features

*   **Lua Runtime:** Execute Lua scripts.
*   **Code Bundling:** Bundle multiple Lua files into a single file.
*   **Dependency Resolution:** Resolve Lua module requirements.
*   **Executable Builder:** Create standalone executables from your Lua projects.

## Usage
### Running Lua files

You can run a single Lua file:
```bash
lulu run single.lua
```

You can also run a project with a `main.lua` and a `lulu.conf.lua`:

```bash
lulu run main.lua
```

### Bundling
Lulu can bundle your project into a single `.lulib` file:
```bash
lulu bundle main.lua /path/to/main.lulib
```

### Building an executable
You can build a standalone executable from your project. The build process is defined in your `lulu.conf.lua`.

```bash
lulu build /path/to/project
# or
lulu build # means lulu build .
```

### Dependency Management
Lulu can resolve and cache dependencies from URLs or git repositories.

To resolve all dependencies for a project, run `resolve` in the project directory:

```bash
lulu resolve .
```

You can also resolve a single dependency:
```bash
lulu resolve github:user/repo
```

You can manage the cache with the `cache` command:
```bash
# List all cached packages
lulu cache list

# Clear the entire cache
lulu cache clear

# Remove a specific package from the cache
lulu cache remove <package_url>
```
